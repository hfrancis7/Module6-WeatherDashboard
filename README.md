# Module6-WeatherDashboard
Using the weather API provided, this week's challenge was to build a weather application that allows the user to search for cities, provide the current weather of the city, and give a 5 day forecast. Cities that have already been searched are saved in a list that the user can use to display information on cities they've searched before, utilizing local storage.
